# PDM_BakeryManagement

We are Nguyen Minh Viet - ITDSIU21130 and Nguyen Quoc Huy - ITDSIU21067 from Principles of Database Management_S1_24G1L2-Tue-Afternoon class. This is the project that we've been working on about bakery management. This project simulates the scenario where Leila's staves need to access the database in order to view and manage their data, or simply to check their order. The system was established with all fundamental knowledge so there is room for growth and improvements. In our report, we included the links to GitHub and our presentation video at the end of the conclusion.
